        Contact your liaison librarian to check for an online or adequate substitute. The University Libraries encourages you to utilize online resources that the library has paid for you to access.  Finding a similar work that the University Libraries owns that would also illustrate the instructional point will release you from the need to seek permission.

        Alternatively

        If the article meets criteria for Fair Use, you may post a PDF or put it on print reserve. Always include a copyright statement as the first page of the document.</li>

        Articles and book chapters provided through Interlibrary Loan are for personal use only, and the PDF should not be posted in Blackboard or distributed to students.

        Contact your liaison librarian to check for online availability of the article or book chapter, or to help you locate an adequate substitute. The University Libraries encourages you to use materials available through its licensed online resources. Though you may need to reconsider the work you originally selected, using a similar work owned by the University Libraries or a freely available substitute that would also illustrate the instructional point will release you from the need to seek permission from the copyright holder.</li>

        In some cases, you (as the author) retain the rights to distribute copies of the published work â€“ but in many cases, authors give up that right during the publication process.  You can check the SHERPA/RoMEO for Publisher copyright policies and self-archiving.  You cannot assume that you own the copyright to your published work.

        If a book is out of print but still under copyright protection

        You may place the print book or copied book chapters on print reserve. If you would like to make content available online to students, there may be an argument for more use of content beyond the generally accepted fair use guidelines limiting use to 10% or 1 chapter of the book, whichever is less. It is important that any posted chapters:

        1. Be hosted restricted access area, such as Blackboard, which limits access to students enrolled in the class.

        2. have access restricted to a reasonable time frame in accordance with the course syllabus. Date and time restrictions to content can be easily set in Blackboard.

        Consult with your liaison librarian if you have questions.</li>
